### Project Overview

This project explores the performance differences between Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Stable Diffusion Models (SDM) for generating terrain imagery from satellite data.

### Files

- [Project Paper (PDF)](/gan-vs-sdm-project/gan-vs-sdm-paper.pdf)
- [Presentation (PDF)](/gan-vs-sdm-project/gan-vs-sdm-presentation.pdf)
- [GAN Model Code (Python)](/gan-vs-sdm-project/gan_model.py)
- [Stable Diffusion Model Code (Python)](/gan-vs-sdm-project/sdm_model.py)
- [FID Calculation Code (Python)](/gan-vs-sdm-project/fid_calculation.py)

### Key Highlights

- **Comparison Metrics:** Evaluation was based on Frechet Inception Distance (FID), loss metrics, and visual inspection.
- **Results:** Stable Diffusion was identified as the more promising model for generating realistic terrain images.
- **Future Work:** Incorporate higher-resolution datasets to improve the realism of generated terrain images. Explore a hybrid pipeline combining GANs for structural layout generation and Stable Diffusion for detailed refinement. Additional enhancements will be implemented using PyTorch.

Note: Sample images used in this project are sourced from the [EuroSAT Dataset](https://github.com/phelber/eurosat).
