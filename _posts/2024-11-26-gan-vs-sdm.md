### Project Overview

This project explores the performance differences between Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Stable Diffusion Models (SDM) for generating terrain imagery from satellite data.

---

### Key Highlights

- **Comparison Metrics:** Evaluation was based on Frechet Inception Distance (FID), loss metrics, and visual inspection.
- **Results:** Stable Diffusion was identified as the more promising model for generating realistic terrain images.
- **Future Work:** Incorporate higher-resolution datasets to improve the realism of generated terrain images. Explore a hybrid pipeline combining GANs for structural layout generation and Stable Diffusion for detailed refinement. Additional enhancements will be implemented using PyTorch.
